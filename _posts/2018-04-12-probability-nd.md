From [John D. Cook's] blog:
>It seems absurd to say the probability is concentrated in a shell. The multivariate normal density has its greatest value at the origin and quickly decays as you move out in any direction. So most of the probability must be near the origin, right? No, because mass equals density times volume. The density decays quickly as you move away from the origin, but volume increases quickly. The product of the two is greatest at some radius away from the origin. Thatâ€™s the shell.
