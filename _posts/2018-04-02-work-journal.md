This year, I started keeping a productivity journal. The goal of this journal is to track the progress I've made on various research tasks without spending much time discussing details. I had been stuck on a single problem ona particular project for weeks, and was worried that I had not actually done any work for several days. I should point out that this happens all the time in research, so I wasn't particularly embarrassed or worried about my progress, rather I felt like I needed to build some momentum, and needed to be able to look back and see what I had tried on a given day.
