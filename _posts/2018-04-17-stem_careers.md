Last spring I had the opportunity to [share some thoughts about STEM careers](http://stemcareer.com/2017/02/open-to-opportunities-interview-with-biomedical-engineer-zach-fox/) and how I ended up where I am now. 
Be sure to check out the other posts on this site - they provide tons of resources to inspire students and practical tools to help them find careers.
