# hi there, I'm zach fox!
I'm a PhD student studying computational and systems biology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO. 
My PhD work so far has been devoted to developing new computational technologies that describe stochastic gene regulation. 
As new techniques allow experimental biologists to measure biomolecules with higher precision, computational modeling has room for massive improvements that incorporate these data to make better predictions and design more effective experiments. My research focuses on using state-of-the-art biological data to more efficiently identify predictive models of stochastic gene expression. I am passionate about computation and predictive modeling, especially in noisy systems.

When I'm not working on my PhD, I spend most of my time traveling to rock climbing with my wife, Korie in our van with our dog Juniper. We also have a cat, Oswald, who is far more adventurous than the rest of us.
