    <h1>Hi there, I'm Zach Fox!</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Zach Fox.  I'm a PhD student studying systems and computational biology. Lately, I've been developing new tools to analyze stochastic gene expression. Check out <a "https://https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PrYu53UAAAAJ&hl=en" google scholar> to see more about my academic work. 

When I'm not working on my PhD, I spend most of my time climbing with my beautiful wife, or playing with my critters.  I'm passionate about the outdoors and anything to do with the vertical world. I also have a van, Gladys. She'll make regular apprearances on the site.
