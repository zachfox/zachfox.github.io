Iâ€™m a PhD student studying computational and systems biology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO.
My PhD work has been devoted to developing new computational technologies that describe stochastic gene regulation. 
As new techniques allow experimental biologists to measure biomolecules with higher precision, computational modeling has room for massive improvements that incorporate these data to make better predictions and design more effective experiments. 
My research focuses on using modern gene expression data to more efficiently identify predictive models of stochastic gene regulation. 
I am passionate about computation and predictive modeling, especially in noisy systems. Check out [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PrYu53UAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1&oi=ao) to see a comprehensive list of publications.


Outside of my academic work, I spend my time rock climbing, playing tennis, reading, and running.
