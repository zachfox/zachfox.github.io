<h1> Thanks for visiting.</h1>
I am currently a Research Scientist for AI in health at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Prior to joining Oak Ridge in the fall of 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Lab](https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/) and at [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/experimental-and-computational-methods-for-modeling-cellular-processes/).  


I did my PhD studies in computational and systems biology with [Brian Munsky](http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~munsky/) at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO.
My PhD work developed new computational methods to compare stochastic models of gene expression and modern single cell data. 

I am passionate about computation and predictive modeling, especially in stochastic systems. Check out [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PrYu53UAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1&oi=ao) to see a comprehensive list of publications. 


Outside of work, I spend my time rock climbing, playing tennis, reading, and running.
