This GUI is largely the work of Will Raymond and Luis Aguilera in Brian Munsky's group at Colorado State. It is a software package which allows one to simulate dynamics of translating proteins using amino-acid specific elongation rates. For full details, see below. I contributed c++ codes to speed up Gillespie simulations as well as some of the original python codes for simulating stochastic elongation of nascent proteins.
