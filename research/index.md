## [Finite State Projection Based Bounds on the Likelihood of Observing Single-Cell Data](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4960505)
<img src="/assets/samdps.png" alt="likelihood bounds" width="300"> We developed new bounds on the likelihood of observing single-cell data given a discrete-stochastic model. It's cool because:
 * We use modern single-cell  _data_ to derive the bounds. Data and models shouldn't be in different silos. 
 * The algorithm to find the upper bound (which is the novel part) is the [water-filling algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filling_algorithm). 
 * It saves **a bunch of time** in parameter fitting. Check out the paper to understand why, but it amounts to being able to tell two models apart without solving the model to a high precision.
