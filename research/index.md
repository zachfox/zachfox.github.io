## Finite State Projection Based Bounds on the Likelihood of Observing Single-Cell Data
<img src="/assets/samdps.png" alt="likelihood bounds" width="300">
 We developed [new bounds on the likelihood of observing single-cell data](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4960505) given a discrete-stochastic model. It's cool because:
    * We use modern single-cell data to derive the bounds. Models help us learn about the physical system we are studying, but data can be used to help us analyze models, too. 
    * The algorithm to find the upper bound (which is the novel part) is the [water-filling algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filling_algorithm). 
    * It saves _a bunch of time_ in parameter fitting and uncertainty quantification. Check out the paper to understand why, but it amounts to being able to tell two models apart without solving the model to a high precision.
