This page is WIP. In the mean time, check out my [google scholar]("https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PrYu53UAAAAJ&hl=en">google) page for publications. 

I'm also a big fan of the new developer stories on stack exchange. You can check out my page [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/4008104), which highlights my favorite tools for computational modeling in biology.
